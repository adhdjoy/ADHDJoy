## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a certified ADHD Coach, Coach Mentor and trainer and Certified Health & Wellness coach.... and I love learning. Huge Notion fan and have a habit of creating what I can not find that I want to use for work or play. 
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with code and make some of my ideas come to life in this way and just enjoy the creative process. 
 ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m game to collaborate or work with fun folks who would benefit from coaching. 
 ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coaching!  
 You can reach me through my website: adhdjoy.com
 That's all I got for right now. 
 Be wonderful - as you are.
